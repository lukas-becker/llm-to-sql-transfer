[/INST]  Sure! Here's the SQL query to answer the question:SELECT [air_temperature].*, [sun].*FROM [dbo].[air_temperature]INNER JOIN [dbo].[sun] ON [air_temperature].[STATIONS_ID] = [sun].[STATIONS_ID]WHERE [air_temperature].[Date_Time_Measured] = [sun].[Date_Time_Measured]GROUP BY [air_temperature].[STATIONS_ID]HAVING SUM([sun].[Minutes_of_Sunshine]) > (SELECT AVG([air_temperature].[Quality_Level]) * 10)This query joins the `air_temperature` and `sun` tables on the common `STATIONS_ID` column, and filters the results to only include rows where the `Date_Time_Measured` column in both tables match. Then, it groups the results by the `STATIONS_ID` column and calculates the average quality level of the air temperature for each station. Finally, it filters the results to only include stations where the minutes of sunshine are greater than 10 times the average quality level.Note that this query assumes that the `air_temperature` table has a `Quality_Level` column and that the `sun` table has a `Minutes_of_Sunshine` column. If these columns do not exist in these tables, you will need to modify the query accordingly.
